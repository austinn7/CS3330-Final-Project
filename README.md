# CS3330-Final-Project
Final Project created for CS 3330 at the University of Missouri - Columbia. The project is a fitness tracker that allows the user to keep track of data involving workouts and their fitness goals. 
The project utilizes object oriented programming, inheritance, and encapsulation to provide a positive user experience. 
There are three interfaces in which the user can access and manipulate in a variety of ways.
The first of the three interfaces is the home page where the user can access a link to the workouts page, a link to the goals page, and two informational screens regarding the application and my experience leading up to the creation of the application.

The workouts page:
Inside of the workouts page, the user is able to input the data of their workouts and receive information regarding their total sets, total repetitions, and the total volume of the weight moved during their workout.
There are buttons that can be used to add or remove workouts and clear all workout entries.
The user is also able to save and upload data to this page.

The goals page:
Inside of the goals page, the user is able to add, remove, or clear their current goals with appropriate buttons and text boxes.
The are able to save and upload files as needed regarding their goals.

There are nagivational tools on each page that will take the user to their desired page and the user can switch to any page from any page.
In the home page of the application, there are also two informational boxes that the user can access if desired.
The first is the "About the App" page which will highlight the uses of the app and how it was made.
The second is the "About the Developer" page that goes over my experiences as a coder and discusses my career goals and school information.
